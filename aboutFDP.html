	<h1>Web Designing with ReactJS APSSDC FDP </h1>
	<h2>Duration: 40 Hours - 20 July 2020 to 31 July 2020</h2>
<p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the
internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website
development rather than software development. Web design used to be
focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the
mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become
ever-increasingly important.</p>
<p>
A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases,
content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font,
and images used.
